Summary and Info about Trails
Welcome to my first full project for Per Scholas. It is based on a cute, portable, physical board game called Trails by KeyMaster Games (see here: https://keymastergames.com/products/trails), based on a larger KeyMaster game called Parks (https://keymastergames.com/products/parks). The aim of the game is to inspire folks to get out and enjoy the natural splendor of our fanastic national and state parks.

Motivation
I chose to make a digitally reimagined Trails as my project because I love playing the physical version and wanted to test my newly acquired Javascript Canvas skills by recreating it in code. Playing niche board games is big part of my free time, and I wanted to bring the magic that I feel when playing them to the screen for others to enjoy.

How to Play
As described on my landing page, two players are hiking along a park trail, collecting resources, photos, and badges along the way, all the while increasing their victory points. The hiker with the most points when the sun returns to its original position at the trail head (the first game tile) wins!

To move along the game board, players use the left and right arrow keys, and to indicate that they're finished with their turn, they click the Finish Turn button, signaling to the script that the other player is now to go. Each time a user views their badges, earns (purchases) badges, rolls the dice, activates their canteen, and moves their icon, the DOM is updated to reflect the changes that have been made under the hood. As this game is not commonly played, I have placed a rules button linking the user to the landing page for a rules refresher at any time (without losing the progress they're made in the game already).

Each photo is accompanied by a caption that is automatically updated in the DOM, featuring a fun fact or two about the location pictured (thanks to Wikipedia for the free, public information about these gorgeous parks!). All locales in the game are State or National Parks in the US, and building this game further inspired me to plan future trips to these awe-inspiring sites (though I have been lucky enough to visit Letchworth State Park and Great Smoky Mountains National Park so far!)

Technologies & How I Built My Game
HTML, HTML Canvas, CSS, JavaScript, JS Context API
Building this digitally reimagined Trails was daunting because it is my first project using HTML Canvas and the Context API, which according to MDN "provides a means for drawing graphics" via JavaScript and the canvas element in the HTML file. I started by getting the bare-bones of the site written in my HTML and CSS files, deciding what absolutely needed to visually be there (like the title, the canvas itself, a start button, etc.) Then, I pseudocoded in my script file the most important base functionality of the game (for example, moving the hiker tokens, the sun moving along with them, and hikers being able to collect and earn badges).

Then came the difficult part: actually making my vision come to life. I knew that I wanted my hikers to move seamlessly onscreen (appear in the next place and disappear in the previous) and to load my resource images to the bottom of the canvas screen (to set them each in their own tile to represent what a hiker gets by landing there) but implementing those were harder than expected. I was able to come to the conclusion of needing a function that clears the board and redraws everything, every time a hiker moves, or recieves a new photo (i.e., a new background image is drawn). After implementing these changes, I needed to create the functions responsible for collecting badge cards, paying for badge cards, updating points, and rolling the dice. These presented their own challenges, but ultimately after long hours of effort I trouble shooted how to debug my original code.

Achievements
I was able to accomplish some stretch goals, mainly a way to reset the board and play again, responsive design, and relatively aesthtically pleasing CSS and color palette (courtesy of cooler.io color generator). For my first project using JavaScript and the context API, I'm proud of myself for successfully writing nearly 1000 lines of code, utilizing over a dozen functions to interact together and ultimately orchestrating one of my favorite board games.

Challenges/Unsolved Issues
One of my greatest challenges was figuring out how to load the resource and background images. I ran into many pathway issues, and having to configure and reconfigure how to make them show up when I wanted them to and how I wanted them to was disconcerting to say the least. Another challenge I encountered was trying to draw background images as if the players drew them as a card (i.e. one player collects a photo and the next player collects the next new photo, and so on). Despite days of trying, I was unable to make this feature fully functional. While it partilly works, some background images are skipping through and I don't yet understand why.

Future Features
Adding a function that computerizes a player so someone can play by themselves without being both hikers.

Adding ability of players to pick which badge they want to earn on that turn (giving them the opportunity to save up resources for a specific badge)
